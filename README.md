# Cub3D

Welcome to `Cub3D`, a project inspired by the legendary game "Wolfenstein 3D" from id Software. This project is designed to explore the fundamentals of 3D graphics with ray-casting technology, simulating a three-dimensional perspective within a two-dimensional map using the MiniLibX library.

## Project Overview

`Cub3D` aims to create a playful and educational introduction to the techniques of ray-casting. The game involves navigating a maze represented by a 2D grid from a first-person perspective, enhanced by simple texture mapping and sprite rendering techniques.

## Features

- **Ray-Casting Engine:** Implement ray-casting to generate a 3D perspective in a 2D map.
- **Texture Mapping:** Apply textures to walls, floors, and ceilings for a more immersive environment.
- **Sprite Rendering:** Display and manage 2D sprites within the 3D space.
- **Dynamic Controls:** Move throughout the map with keyboard controls to explore the game space.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a C compiler, make, and the MiniLibX library installed on your system, configured to work with the X11 windowing system.

### Compilation

Clone the repository and compile the game:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fayeza99/Cub3D.git
cd Cub3D
make
